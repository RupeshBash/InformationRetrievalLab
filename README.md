# Information Retrieval Lab

This project includes text preprocessing steps for raw user reviews. Each Python file handles one specific task:

- `dataset.py`: Loads a sample dataset with sports-related reviews.
- `remove_emojis.py`: Removes emojis from text.
- `lowercase.py`: Converts text to lowercase.
- `remove_html_urls.py`: Removes HTML tags and URLs.
- `remove_punctuation.py`: Removes punctuation.
- `remove_stopwords.py`: Removes common stopwords.
- `expand_short_forms.py`: Replaces short forms like "pls" with full forms like "please".
- `correct_spelling.py`: Corrects spelling mistakes.
- `stemming.py`: Applies stemming.
- `lemmatization.py`: Applies lemmatization.
- `main.py`: Runs all preprocessing steps together.

Run each file separately to test the module, or use `main.py` to apply them all in sequence.
